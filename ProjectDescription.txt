In project 1, you built a simple database system for storing, removing, and querying a collection of rectangles by name or position. The data structure used to organize the collection of rectangles was a SkipList. The Skip List is efficient for finding rectangles by name. However, it is not so good for finding rectangles by location. This was salient when implementing the region search and intersections operations. The problem is that there are two distinct keys by which we would like to search for rectangles (name or location). So we should expect that we will need two data structures, one to organize by each key. However, even if we added a second SkipList to the system, we would still have the problem that the Skip List simply is not a good data structure for the tasks of finding all rectangles that intersect a query rectangle, or finding all intersections from among a collection of rectangles. What we really need is another data structure that can perform these spatial tasks well.


Your database will now be organized by TWO data structures. One will be the SkipList you already have from project 1, which will organize the collection of objects by name. The second data structure will be a variant of the PRQuadTree, as described below. In order to simplify the mechanics of the insert and delete operations on the PRQuadTree, the data objects being stored will be points instead of rectangles. The PRQuadTree will organize the points by position, and will be used for spatial queries such as locating points within a query rectangle, and determining the duplicate points.


Before reading the following description of the PRQuadTree variant used for this project, you should first read Modules 15.2 and 15.3 in OpenDSA. You are implementing something similar to the PRQuadTree as described in Module 15.3, but there are some important differences in the split and merge rules.


You will use a variant of the PRQuadTree to support spatial queries. The PRQuadTree is a full tree such that every node is either a leaf node, an empty node, or an internal node with four children.   Leaf nodes will contain one or more Points as data.  Empty nodes will have no data, but can still behave like most nodes.  Internal nodes will have 4 children, but no data.   As with the PRQuadTree described in OpenDSA, the four children split the parent’s corresponding square into four equal-sized quadrants. The internal nodes of the PRQuadTree do not store data. Pointers to the points themselves are stored only in the leaf nodes.

Invocation and I/O Files

The program will be invoked from the command-line as:

   %> java PointsDatabase {commandFile}

where:

    PointsDatabase is then name of the program. The file where you have your main() method must be called PointsDatabase.java

    commandFile is the name of the command file to read.

Your program will read from the text file {command-file} a series of commands, with one command per line. The program should terminate after reading the end of the file. You are guaranteed that the commands in the file will be syntactically correct in all graded test cases. The commands are free-format in that any number of spaces may come before, between, or after the command name and its parameters. All commands should generate the required output message. All output should be written to standard output. Every command that is processed should generate some sort of output message to indicate whether the command was successful or not.

The command file may contain any mix of the following commands. In the following description, terms in { } are parameters to the command.

    insert {name} {x} {y}

    Insert a point with name name at spatial 2D location (x, y). It is permissible for two or more points to have the same name, and it is permissible for two or more points to have the same spatial position, but not both. The name must begin with a letter, and may contain letters, digits, and underscore characters. Names are case-Sensitive. A point should be rejected for insertion if either of its coordinates are not greater than 0. All points must exist within the “world box” that is 1024 by 1024 units in size and has upper left corner at (0, 0). If a point coordinates is outside of this box, it should be rejected for insertion.

    remove {name}

    Remove the point with the name name. If two or more points have the same name, then only one such point may be removed. If no point exists with this name, it should be so reported.

    remove {x} {y}

    Remove the point with the location {x} {y}. If two or more points have the same location, then only one such point may be removed. If no point exists with this location, it should be so reported.

    regionsearch {x} {y} {w} {h}

    Report all points currently in the database that are contained in the query rectangle specified by the 'regionsearch' parameters. For each such point, list out its name and coordinates. A regionsearch command should be rejected if the height or width are not greater than 0. However, it is (syntactically) acceptable for the regionsearch rectangle to be all or partly outside of the 1024 by 1024 world box. Additionally, you must report the number of QuadTree nodes visited by the search.

    duplicates

    Report all points that have duplicate coordinates.

    search {name}

    Return the information about the points(s), if any, that have name {name}.

    dump

    Return a “dump” of the SkipList and the QuadTree.

        The SkipList dump should print out each SkipList node, from left to right. For each SkipList node, print that node’s value and the number of pointers that it contains.

        The QuadTree dump should print the nodes of the QuadTree in preorder traversal, one node per line, with each line indented by 2 spaces for each level in the tree (the root will indent 0 spaces since it is considered to be at level 0). These lines should appear after the SkipList nodes are printed.


Split and Merge Rules

The key property of any QuadTree data structure is its decomposition rule. The decomposition rule is what distinguishes the PRQuadTree of this project from the PRQuadTree described in OpenDSA. The decomposition rule for this project is:

A leaf node will split into an internal node with four children when

    1. There are more than three points in the node, such that ...

    2. not all of the points have the same x and y coordinates.

So there is no limit in principle to the number of points stored in a single leaf node, if they all happen to have the same position.

On the other hand, four sibling leaf nodes will merge together to form a single leaf node whenever deleting a point results in a set of points among the four leaves that does not violate the decomposition rule. It is possible for a single insertion to cause a cascading series of node splits. It is also possible for a single deletion to cause a cascading series of node merges.
Design Considerations

The points will be maintained in a SkipList sorted by the name. Use String's compareTo() method to determine the relative ordering of two names, and to determine if two names are identical. You are using the SkipList to maintain your list of points, but the SkipList is a general container class. Therefore, it should not be implemented to know anything about points. However, you don't need to implement the QuadTree as a generic data structure, because it can only store spatial objects. It is fine to build the QuadTree storing only Point objects. 

We will define the origin of the system to be the upper-left corner, with the axes increasing in positive value down and to the right. We will designate the children of the PRQuadTree (and the quadrants of the world) to be NW, NE, SW, and SE, in that order. We will assume that the “world” is a square with upper-left corner at (0, 0), and height and width of 1024 units.

All access functions on the PRQuadTree, including insert, remove, regionsearch, and duplicates must be written recursively. The regionsearch and duplicates commands will access the PRQuadTree rather than the SkipList. These commands should visit as few QuadTree nodes as possible.

You must use class inheritance to design your PRQuadTree nodes. You must have a PRQuadTree node base class (or interface), with subclasses for the internal nodes and the leaf nodes. Note the discussion below regarding using a flyweight to implement empty leaf nodes. Your QuadTree node implementation should not include a pointer to the parent node.

The most obvious design issue is how to organize the inter-relations between the SkipList and the PRQuadTree. Neither uniquely “owns” the points that it organizes. You will probably want each data structure to store pointers to (shared) point objects.

It is a good idea to create a “Database” class and create one object of the class. This Database class will receive the commands to insert, delete, search, etc., and farm them out to the SkipList and/or PRQuadTree for actual implementation.

Many leaf nodes of the PRQuadTree will contain no data. Storing many distinct “empty” leaf nodes is quite wasteful. One design option is to store a NULL pointer to an empty leaf node in its parent. However, this requires the parent node to understand this convention, and explicitly check the value of its child pointers before proceeding, with special action taken if the pointer is NULL. A better design is to use a“flyweight” object. A flyweight is a single empty leaf node that is created one time at the beginning of the program, and pointed to whenever an empty child node is needed.

When navigating through the PRQuadTree, for example to do an insert operation, you will need to know the coordinates and size of the current PRQuadTree node. One design option is to store with each PRQuadTree node its coordinates and size. However, this is unnecessary and wastes space. Worse, it is incompatible with the Flyweight design pattern, since the flyweight object has to be stateless. Given the coordinates and size of a node, it is a simple matter to determine the coordinates and size of its children. Thus, a better design is to pass in the location and size of the current node as parameters down to the recursive calls.
Milestones

There are two milestones over the course of project 2, and they can have an effect on the 'design' grade on the project.  If you MISS 1 milestone, there is a 5 point penalty. If you MISS all two milestones, there is a 10 point penalty.  The main point behind enforcing milestones is to make you start as soon as possible in the project and to avoid procrastination.  It also gives you a good measure of progress on the project, so you can estimate if you are behind or ahead of schedule. 

    Milestone 1: Due date: Feb 25, 2024 @11:59 PM ET 
        Pass at least 1 Web-CAT instructor reference tests. You also need to have the project's skeleton (without functionality) completed.
        You should have a QuadNode interface and InternalNode, LeafNode, EmptyNode, and QuadTree classes. 
    Milestone 2: Due date: March 03, 2024 @11:59 PM ET 
        Pass at least 7 Web-CAT instructor reference tests.
        In practice, this means that you need to have your insert and search methods working.
